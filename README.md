# Netflix Clone

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This project is a React.js application built with Tailwind CSS, offering a user-friendly interface inspired by Netflix. It integrates features like card transformations, calling TMDB API to fetch movie data, search functionality, and a watchlist feature. The application utilizes React Router for navigation and implements debouncing in the search feature for enhanced performance.
